a Simple blog
====
Initially an exercise project for school: a simple blog. Now I use it to test it to test stuff and iterate the application structure to match best practices of Spring and web.

Some technologies used:
	* Java EE Web
	* Spring (WebMVC, Security, JPA/Data)
	* Twitter Bootstrap
